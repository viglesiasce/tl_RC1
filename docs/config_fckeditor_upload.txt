Bin-Blog - Enabling Image Uploading in FCKEditor for PHP

FCKEditor is one of the most feature rich web based WYSWYG editors. 
I use it for almost all my projects. However, if you wish to enable image uploading in it, 
you have to jump through some hoops. 
This is a small tutorial on how to enable image uploading in FCKEditor. 
This tutorial is aimed at FCKEditor 2.3.2 - but the principle works in other versions of FCKEditor as well

-- Configuration --

Open the file FCKEditor/fckconfig.js

Make sure that the default php connector is selected.
Search for:
var _FileBrowserLanguage = 'php' ; // asp | aspx | cfm | lasso | perl | php | py
var _QuickUploadLanguage = 'php' ; // asp | aspx | cfm | lasso | php

By default, the ASP connector is enabled. 

-- Connector --
Open FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/php/config.php

Enable the connector
// SECURITY: You must explicitelly enable this "connector". (Set it to "true").
$Config['Enabled'] = true ;

Make sure that the given 'UserFilesPath' folder exists in the server and has write permission.
$Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/UserFiles/' ;

For TestLink we suggest:
<TL_HOME>/upload_area/fckeditor_upload_area/

Comment line:
$Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = '' ;

-- Uploader --

Open file FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/upload/php/config.php

Enable the uploader
// SECURITY: You must explicitelly enable this "uploader". 
$Config['Enabled'] = true ;

Make sure that the given 'UserFilesPath' folder exists in the server and has write permission.
$Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/UserFiles/' ;

For TestLink we suggest:
<TL_HOME>/upload_area/fckeditor_upload_area/

Comment line:
$Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = '' ;
